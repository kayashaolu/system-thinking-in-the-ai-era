1. Service Building Block (The Blocking Problem)
2. Queue + Worker Building Blocks (Message-Based Async Processing)
3. Queue Distributing to Multiple Workers (Parallel Processing)
4. Queue + Worker Failure Handling (System Resilience)

After each experiment, you'll reflect on your architectural discoveries.

🔍 Your Service vs Queue + Worker Discoveries:
   • Service building block: Blocking operations create terrible user experiences
   • Queue building block: Enables message persistence, routing, and load balancing
   • Worker building block: Provides non-blocking background processing power
   • Service alone: Sequential, blocking, single point of failure
   • Queue + Worker together: Responsive, scalable, resilient systems
   • Queue distribution enables horizontal scaling across multiple Workers
   • Queue + Worker fault isolation prevents system-wide failures

💡 THE SYSTEM THINKING INSIGHT - Same Work, Different Building Blocks:
   • You executed the SAME work functions (process_image_work, send_email_work, etc.)
   • Service building block: Executed work synchronously, blocking the UI
   • Worker building block: Executed work asynchronously, never blocking the UI
   • The BUSINESS LOGIC was identical - only the EXECUTION PATTERN changed!
   • This separation is the essence of system thinking: separate WHAT from HOW
   • Building blocks don't change the work - they change how and when it executes
   • Good architects choose building blocks based on execution requirements, not work type

📊 Your Building Block Comparison Times:
   • Service Building Block: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_1', 0):.1f}s (UI frozen entire time)
   • Queue + Worker: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_2', 0):.1f}s (UI always responsive)
   • Queue → Multiple Workers: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_3', 0):.1f}s (distributed processing)
   • Queue + Worker Resilience: {self.experiment_times.get('experiment_4', 0):.1f}s (handled failures gracefully)

🏗️ You now understand why these companies use Queue + Worker instead of Service alone:
   • Instagram: Queue routes photo jobs to Worker farms (not blocking Service calls)
   • Netflix: Queue distributes video encoding to Worker clusters (not sequential Service processing)
   • Gmail: Queue handles email delivery through Worker processes (not blocking Service requests)
   • Uber: Queue manages ride requests across Worker services (not single Service bottleneck)

🎓 You've completed your system thinking transformation! You now think like an AI-empowered system thinker who understands:
   • When to use Service building blocks (fast, synchronous operations)
   • When to use Queue + Worker building blocks (scalable, resilient, async operations)
   • How building block choices impact user experience and system reliability
