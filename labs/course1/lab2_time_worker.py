Systems Thinking in the AI Era I: Universal Building Blocks
Lesson 8: Time + Worker - Scheduled Processing Discovery Lab
Interactive lab exploring automated Time + Worker patterns and background processing

This lab demonstrates system thinking skills that complement AI capabilities:
1. Manual vs automated Worker task execution
2. Time + Worker pattern for automated processing
3. Multiple Time entities for different business domains
4. Error handling and system resilience
